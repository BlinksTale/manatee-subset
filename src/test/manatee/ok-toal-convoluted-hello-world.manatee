--code directly from manatee notes
--NOTE: THIS CODE WAS COMMENTED OUT SINCE MODULES ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED

-- This is a pretty interesting Manatee program.
-- It writes "hello, world" to standard output.
-- It is more confusing than it needs to be.

--use module Text
my place is "world"
--greet(place)
--to greet string s:
--    write uppercase("hello, " + s)
--end
