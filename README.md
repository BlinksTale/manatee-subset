This is a compiler for a subset of the Manatee Programming Language.

When complete, students will be able to fork this repository to build compilers
and interpreters for the full language.

Manatee is described at http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/manatee.

Here are some of the full language features not implemented in this subset:

* Modules
* DONE: Codepoint escapes in character and string literals
* DONE: Object types and literals
* PARTIALLY AXED, but still need for stdio (but no files): Streams for reading and writing
* DONE: Increment and decrement statements
* Parallel assignment
* DONE: Exceptions
* DONE: Timers
* DONE: `unless` and `until` modifiers
* DONE: Bitwise operators
* DONE: Modulo operator
* DONE: Divides operator
* DONE: Bitwise complement operator
